How To Transfer Files and Deploy
1) Can transfer files with $sudo scp -r -i ./GroupActivityRecognition.pem /path/to/local ubuntu@<Public IPV4 address>:/path/to/copy
1.1) Try to avoid transferring lots of files (i.e. dependencies), instead install these while on the server
2) Connect to instance with $ssh -i ./GroupActivityRecognition.pem ubuntu@<Public IPV4 address>
3) $cd api
4) go into virtual environment with $source env/bin/activate
5) run flask app in background with $python3 app.py &
6) leave ssh with $exit
7) access api with <Public IPV4 address>:8080/<api-path>
7) MAKE SURE to stop the instance when you're done using it. This will change the Public IPV4 address and the Public IPV4 DNS on the next run but the data on the server with remain.
