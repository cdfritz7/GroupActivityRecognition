# GroupActivityRecognition - Simulator

Implements a discrete event simulator for evaluating the group activity recognition approach. 

This simulator works by replaying recorded sensor streams (from real devices) from multiple agents one sample at a time and performing inferences on batches (frames) of them. The classifier used is trained on accelerometer x, y, z samples collected at 100Hz.
